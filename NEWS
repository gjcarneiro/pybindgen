=== pybindgen 0.12 ===

    - Now we can catch C++ exceptions and translate them into Python

    - New API to add container iteration powers to wrapped C++ classes

    - Unary minus operator support (J. Michael Owen)

    - CppMethod: is_pure_virtual=True should imply is_virtual=True

    - More polish for numeric operators with non-class right operand

    - Virtual methods regressions fixed

    - gccxmlparser: don't try to wrap private/protected operators

    - MSVC compilation fix

    - unsigned long type handlers (J. Michael Owen)

    - tp_len/__len__ works now with overloaded methods (J. Michael Owen)

    - Add foreign_cpp_namespace option to Function wrappers

    - Misc. cleanup and bug fixes


=== pybindgen 0.11 ===
    - Generate code that supports GCC's -fvisibility=hidden

    - Add rudimentary support for std::map containers

    - Some inplace numeric operators now supported (J. Michael Owen)

    - Partial sequence protocol support: __len__, __getitem__,
      and __setitem__ (J. Michael Owen)

    - Partially support pointer-to-container parameters

    - Call traceback.extract_stack() less often (faster on win32)

    - No need for GIL locking in attribute setters (thanks Stuart Stock)

    - Allow wrapping enum given list of (name, value) pairs

    - New foreign_cpp_namespace option, for wrapping classes outside
      our module's C++ namespace

    - Add a docstring parameter to CppMethod constructor (Robin Gilks)
      Also add a docstring parameter for CppClass

    - Better support for typedefs

    - Implement support for enum reference parameters

    - Add support for size_t "by-value" type

=== pybindgen 0.10 ===

    - New null_ok, default_value options for pointer-to-class parameters;

    - Thread safety fixes;

    - Map C++ operator() into Python's tp_call (__call__);

    - Initial support for std containers (except mapping containers);

    - Generate __copy__ methods for classes with copy contructor;

    - Add 'wrapper registry' optional feature (off by default): allows
      C++ instances returned by pointer to be consistently wrapped
      always by the same Python wrapper, so that the 'is' operator can
      be used for identity testing;

    - New C type expression parser, is_const not longer needed for
      parameter types, just put const in the type string as
      appropriate;

    - Sort the declarations returned by (py)gccxml.  If generating
      python script files from gccxml scanning, now the output file
      becomes more stable and less prone to move declarations up and
      down with different people scanning and the output file is under
      version control;

    - Map binary comparison operators (< <= == >= >) from C++ to Python;

    - Map some binary numeric operators (+ - * /) from C++ to Python;

    - Allow installation of pybindgen even if no C/C++ compiler is detected;

    - Fix compatibility with older Python versions (tested with 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5)


=== pybindgen 0.9 ===
    - Fix GCC 4.2 compilation warnings;
    - Works with some GCCXML 0.9/cvs snapshots (tested with 2008-04-20),
      in addition to stable 0.7;
    - Support for overloaded virtual methods;
    - Add 'ignore' annotation support, allowing to ignore functions
      and methods;
    - Generally work hard to make sure the generated code at least
      always compiles, even if we have to disable generation of
      certain wrappers;
    - Add support for protected methods and constructors;
    - Preliminary support for templated classes/methods/functions;
    - Add more type conversions, such as uint64_t and uint16_t;
    - Support implicit conversions also for pass-by-reference parameters;
    - Add supported for nested (i.e. defined inside a class) enums and classes;
    - Add support for adding manually written custom method or function wrappers;
    - Split the gccxmlparser.ModuleParser.parse() method into several
      smaller methods, to allow greater customization and flexibility;
    - Add support for customising C++ class instance creation code;
    - Much improved support for wrapping pure C code;
    - Support std::ostream << myobject mapped as str(myobject) (Mathieu Lacage)
    - Support default values in parameters;
    - More intuitive API (thanks Mathieu Lacage for feedback)
    - Support generation of a Python pybindgen script from scanned API;
    - Support splitting of generated python script and/or C/C++ module into several files;
    - Lots of small bug fixes, and other features I probably forgot;
    - New tutorial (thanks Mathieu Lacage), and API docs.

          getters supported before).


=== pybindgen 0.4 ===
        - Support reference counted C++ classes
        - Generated code compiles with Python >= 2.3
          (though Python >= 2.4 required for pybindgen itself)

=== pybindgen 0.3 ===
        - Supports methods and functions with parameters of a class
type (for classes being wrapped).  Pass by pointer, value, or ref
supported, with in/out/inout directions, and transfer of ownership, as
well as value/pointer class return type.  Reference counted classes
not yet supported.


=== pybindgen 0.2 ===
        - Supports wrapping classes, but not yet functions/methods
with class parameters;
